Problems are split into groups of ten and put in folders. The newest versions of Helper.h 
and Helper.cpp are always in the topmost folder. If a problem solution includes "Helper.h", 
Helper.cpp must be compiled with it. If other special compiling rules are necessary, they 
will be included in a comment at the top of the problem solution.

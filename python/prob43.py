"""
The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.

Let d1 be the 1st digit, d2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:

    d2 d3 d4 = 406 is divisible by 2
    d3 d4 d5 = 063 is divisible by 3
    d4 d5 d6 = 635 is divisible by 5
    d5 d6 d7 = 357 is divisible by 7
    d6 d7 d8 = 572 is divisible by 11
    d7 d8 d9 = 728 is divisible by 13
    d8 d9 d10= 289 is divisible by 17

Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.

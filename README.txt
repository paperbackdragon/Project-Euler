Updates:
- Work on Python projects has stopped, C++ is now where the main work is done.

Notes on the C++ solutions:
- Solutions are split into groups of ten and put in folders.
- The newest versions of Helper.h and Helper.cpp are always in the topmost folder (Project-Euler/c++/).
- If a solution includes "Helper.h", Helper.cpp must be compiled with it.
- If other special compiling rules are necessary, they will be included in a comment at the top of the solution.

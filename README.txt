Updates:
- Work on the Python solutions is now continuing.

Notes on the C++ solutions:
- Solutions are split into groups of ten and put in folders.
- Each problem's definition and answer (when solved) is included in a comment at the top of each solution.
- Helper.h and Helper.cpp are always in the topmost folder (Project-Euler/c++/).

Notes on compiling C++ solutions:
- If a solution includes "Helper.h", Helper.cpp must be compiled with it. If within a folder, -I.. and ../Helper.cpp must be added to the GCC compile line.
- If other special compiling rules are necessary, they will be included in a comment at the top of the solution.
